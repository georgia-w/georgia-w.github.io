                Steaming Plates
            </header>
            <p>
                Every year right before Christmas, usually on the night before Christmas Eve, my family goes to Veselka. The week before is always spent in anticipation, dreaming of steaming cups of borscht on frosty days full of numb fingers stuffed deep into coat pockets. The night before we drive up to my grandparents in Boston, before the hectic family affairs and stressful dinner planning, we have a celebration of our own. We make our way into the city, walking down Second Avenue all bundled up in our winter gear with our breath fogging up the air in front of us. Sometimes, the line is long, but usually, on this day so close to the holidays, people are at home with their families. When we walk inside, the warm air feels like a hug welcoming you. The chatter and clinking of knives against plates kiss you hello. We sit down at a small table. Hats, scarves, mittens, and winter coats are haphazardly strewn across chairs, periodically falling onto the floor. My stomach started growling the second we walked in the door. Maybe even before, when I first saw the red awning. We order food as soon as the waiter comes, none of us straying from our usual order. My sister and I have the same exact order, and have for years. Sometimes, we will split everything (that rarely happens). More often, we parrot our orders to the waiter, seemingly copying each other as if we panicked, unsure of what to order. When the food arrives, we try to clear the table of jam and cream (we won’t need it) while the waiters juggle plates. Dishes are precariously piled on the table, not quite fitting, yet somehow we make do. The table turns into a jigsaw puzzle of steaming food. The chatter and din of the restaurant covers us like a warm blanket on a cold night. And inside our little bubble, my family settles.

            <p>As we sit, I look around and try to picture the past. This restaurant holds many memories for my family. It holds history, important moments. On the first night they met, my parents came here. When my mom was younger, she would visit her sister in the ‘big city’, and they would come here as a special treat. Not only does this place hold my memories growing up, but those of my mom, my sister, my dad, my aunt, and my cousin. And those are just within my family. These wooden seats have seen monumental moments in the lives of so many. They hold history, stories, and secrets.

                I’ve always felt like I’ve learned the most about my parents' lives and history from the stories they tell others. Here, I feel like I learn it firsthand. They sit at tables, talking about how that one waitress has worked here forever, or how they used to come and get a peppermint patty from a bowl by the door every time they left, or how they used to have this drink. These seemingly minute details lead them to recount other stories, adventures from the past. Listening to these stories makes me feel like a little kid reading a storybook, eagerly waiting to hear what is going to happen, listening to see if there are any surprise appearances from people I know. Instead, the stories are usually full of people I’ve never heard of (that I remember). The quiet din of the room surrounds us like a bubble as I look around, trying to imagine my parents sitting here 30 years ago. It never works (I don’t have a very active imagination), but every time we go, I still try. These painted walls are full of memories, my parents, mine, and hundreds of other peoples’, and sitting down inside of them feels like a chance to experience those memories. While the restaurant makes you feel like an individual, like your experience there is unique and special, it also makes you feel insignificant. It reminds you that you are just a small part of a big world, and that everyone around you is experiencing different things all the time. It's easy to forget that, even in a city as big as New York. You can so easily get sucked into a vacuum where your only focus is yourself and your experiences, and anything that doesn’t have to do with that can fall away.

                Every time I go to Veselka, I feel like the waiters are competing. They flit around like hummingbirds, here for a second, then gone. Though they only pass you by for a split second, it never feels cold or rude. It’s just the way it is. You walk in from the restless, sometimes overwhelming, city into a restaurant with an energy that can be perceived as similar. But, once you enter, it is clearly different. While the outside din feels like it can drown you, the commotion inside washes over you. Walking down the streets, surrounded by skyscrapers and thousands of lives, you can feel insignificant. In such a big, loud city full of history, you can feel as if no matter what you do, it won’t matter. The chatter when you sit at the diner counter at Veselka, however, gives you the space to be yourself. The many different people eating and living their lives help to show how many other people are living, each one doing their own unique thing.

                Walking into Veselka feels like entering another world. One full of laughter, warmth, and steaming perogies. No matter how long it has been since my last visit, I can always picture the red awning and giant menus waiting to welcome me.
